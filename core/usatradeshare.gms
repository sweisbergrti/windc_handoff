PARAMETER usatrd(r,n,yr,t) "Trade data without units";

* Data originally in millions of dollars. Scale to billions:
usatrd(r,n,yr,t) = usatrd_units(r,n,yr,t,"millions of us dollars (USD)") * 1e-3;


PARAMETER usatrd_(yr,r,s,t) "Mapped trade data";
PARAMETER usatrd_shr(yr,r,s,t) "Share of total trade by region";

usatrd_(yr,r,s,t) = sum(map(n,s), usatrd(r,n,yr,t));

* Which sectors are not mapped? Could be there just aren't any
* imports/exports for a given sector region pairing or the sector isn't
* included (services/utilities). For exports, it would make more sense to
* differentiate sectors not included based on state gross product for a
* given state.

SET notinc(s) "Sectors not included in USA Trade Data";

notinc(s) = yes$(NOT sum(n, map(n,s)));
usatrd_shr(yr,r,s,t)$(NOT notinc(s) and sum(r.local, usatrd_(yr,r,s,t))) = usatrd_(yr,r,s,t) / sum(r.local, usatrd_(yr,r,s,t));

* Note that there isn't data for all years for the publishing sector in
* both exports and imports. Take average of data:

usatrd_shr(yr,r,s,t)$(NOT notinc(s) AND NOT sum(r.local, usatrd_(yr,r,s,t))) = sum(yr.local, usatrd_(yr,r,s,t)) / sum((r.local,yr.local), usatrd_(yr,r,s,t));

* Perform a comparison between import and export shares:

PARAMETER shrchk "Comparison between imports and exports";

shrchk(s,t) = usatrd_shr('2014','CA',s,t);
DISPLAY shrchk;


* Verify all shares sum to 1:
ABORT$(smax((yr,s), round(sum(r, usatrd_shr(yr,r,s,'exports')), 4)) <> 1) "Export shares don't sum to 1.";
ABORT$(smax((yr,s), round(sum(r, usatrd_shr(yr,r,s,'imports')), 4)) <> 1) "Import shares don't sum to 1.";
