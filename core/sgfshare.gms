* Note that government expenditures in the model are treated indirectly. Most
* government administration expenditures are likely born by the production block
* of government related sectors. Thus, expenditures on public sector goods
* probably encompases public utility expenditures and the likes. That being
* said, I map many sectors to these singletons in the WiNDC model to generate
* an index based on aggregated sectors.

* Note that many of the sectors in WiNDC are mapped to the same SGF
* category. Thus, sectors will have equivalent shares.
