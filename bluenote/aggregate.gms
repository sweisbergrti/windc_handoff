$title Sectoral/regional (dis)aggregation routine

* A customized sectoral aggregation/disaggregation requires both disaggregation
* from the 2007-2012 tables and re-aggregation after separating a given
* sector. We provide examples stored in the defines directory for the reference
* case, an energy based and agricultural based dataset. A mechanism for regional
* aggregations are also provided.

* The sectoral disaggregation and subsequent aggregation is done in two
* parts. This program is the latter of the two.
* 	Part 1: Sectoral disaggregation based on choices from 2007-2012 table.
* 	Part 2: Canned routine which aggregates the rest of the dataset.

* Point routine to the correct aggregation file. Environment variable "aggr" must
* be set to the NAME of the mapping file. 'ref' is the reference case without
* any sectoral/regional disaggregation/aggregation and provided only a base to
* work from in the boilerplay portion of the program. Make distinction between
* intended regions/sectors in the target vs. origin dataset.

* file separator
$set sep %system.dirsep%

*	Sectoral aggregation is always bluenote:

*$if not set smap $set smap bluenote
$if not set smap $set smap full_disagg

*	Regional aggregation could be census rather than state:

$if not set rmap $set rmap state

*	Could be soi:

$if not set hhdata $set hhdata cps

*	Output file contains the dataset name and the aggregation info:

$set dsout %hhdata%_%rmap%

*	The input data file is in the bluenote/gdx directory, so we
*	need to define datafile in the call to windc_hhdata, otherwise
*	it assumes the data file is in the household directory.
$set datafile %system.fp%gdx%sep%%hhdata%.gdx

*	Point to the household data directory:

$set hhdatadir %system.fp%..%sep%household%sep%

*	Read the household data:

$set ds WiNDC_%hhdata%_static

$include %hhdatadir%windc_hhdata

*	Sector and region mapping files are in the maps subdirectory:

$if not set mapdir $set mapdir %system.fp%maps%sep%

* --------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Read the sector and geographic mapping files:

$INCLUDE %mapdir%%smap%.map
$INCLUDE %mapdir%%rmap%.map
